# Design principles

- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interface, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
- Principle of Least Knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends (Law of Demeter).
